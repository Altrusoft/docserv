Things that needs to be fixed in docserv

Docs
----
- Remove/Update old README and SETUP
- INSTALL.txt (admin guide)
- USER_GUIDE.txt (usage, write and install template, template with code etc)
- DEVELOPER.txt (dev guide, code structure)


General
-------
- GPL copyright notice (or Apache? or LGPL?)
- Keep the name "docserv"?
- Make the tests less revealing (Anonymous invoice with names and fake prices)


Functionality
------------
- Nested structures (lists within one entry probably does not work)
- Avoid LibreOffice window popup
- Possibility to upload (CRUD) template files, UI
- Possibility to generate multiple files?
- DocX? (ODT->DocX?) (DocX->PDF or DocX---(through ODT)--->PDF?)
- Allow both FTL and VLC (through request-parameter? with FTL as default)


Code Quality
------------
- Make possible to run integtests within Eclipse ("inputstream is not a zip")
- Investigate what to remove to avoid duplicate commons-http (gives Eclipse errors)

- More unit testing
- Fix checkstyle warnings
- No e.prinstStackTrace() (system.out is at least removed)
- Improve logging (more logging and correct levels)

- Analyze / Test-coverage Global.java
- Extract things from Global and Application to separate methods
- Investigate ("grep") TODOs in source code

- Somehow invoke and put under VC my local end-to-end scripts for testing
- Add tool to generate new expected-test-file whenever bits/libreoffice is changed
- Make the tests less brittle
